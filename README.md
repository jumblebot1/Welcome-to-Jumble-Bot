Introduction to Jumble bot

Jumble bot is a fully decentralised project allowing users to obscure transactions through a simple send. 
Our smart contracts are thoroughly audited, they also can’t be tampered with. These features are what makes Jumble bot fully decentralised as even the developers are not able to change the process and play with the contracts. Making funds SAFU.

Users will be provided with a unique combination of letters and numbers which will be different on each transaction. Take good care and save this code, this gives the users of Jumble bot full control over their assets, leaving you the withdraw your funds at any time. The longer funds are left inside the mixer, the more it’ll be jumbled with volume. Making every second that passes more difficult to trace your funds.

Privacy

The smart contract being used will initially accept only ETH. Along with updates and further versions of Jumble bot we will accept and obscure more tokens, this comes with volume. With the contract being used you’re able to deposit from your current address with the funds in it, and using the unique code you’re able to withdraw to another address. 

There are certain steps that you could take to maximise the potential of Jumble bot, such as: leaving your funds for a longer period of time (this will make it harder to trace as there will be further deposits after yours), using a relayer for gas payments to allow you to withdraw to an address with no balance, splitting your transactions into smaller amounts, and many more. 

There will be a few different set amounts which are able to be deposited into the pool to be mixed. This helps users get closer to full privacy as it’d be a lot more difficult for someone to match your transactions without these set pools. 

For example,

User A deposits 0.124 ETH into Jumble bot.
User X deposits 0.44 ETH into Jumble bot.

Nothing has been obscured as it makes it obvious who has withdrawn those specific amounts as it is very unlikely that the next user will match that amount.

To avoid this, we have set pools.

With the set pools the users will be able to deposit 0.1, 1, 5 or 10 ETH.

So now for example,

User A wants to obscure a total of 3.3 ETH
User X wants to obscure a total of 3.5 ETH

Instead of having a deposit of 3.3 and 3.5. User A and User X will be forced to use the set amounts of the pool, which would be.

User A deposits 1 ETH x3 and 0.1 ETH x3
User X deposits 1 ETH x3 and 0.1 ETH x5

This makes it very difficult to trace as it’s hard to differentiate which amount belongs to either User A or User X.

Networks

With volume we plan to implement USDC, USDT, DAI and more tokens. Currently Jumble bot will only accept ETH, but this will change in the near-future.
